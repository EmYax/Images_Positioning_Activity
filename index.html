 <p>Let <a href="google.com" target="_blank">Your Web Site</a> Do Your Work</p>

  <h2> Looks Matter</h2>
<p>If your site looks amateurish, you'll lose credibility with your customers. Avoid using blinking, flashing, scrolling, and crawling text. You're running a business Web site, not a carnival. Choose a readable font in a size that's easy to read. Stick to one font face and not more than three font sizes. It may be interesting to have 10 different font faces on your site, but having too many font faces tends to detract from your site, not enhance it. Your Web site should not look like a ransom note. Use neutral tones or colors that complement each other. Avoid red and green color combinations â€” 5% of the population is <a href="google.com" target="_blank">color blind</a> and may have trouble reading such text. Red is also associated with danger and financial loss.</p>
